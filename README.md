# Multithread-Racing-Simulation
Java Project of a basic Racing Game, focus on the implementation of Design Patterns, and multithreaded process.
	

# Introduction

	Design patterns are the best formalized practices a programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.

	Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms.

	Reusing design patterns help prevent subtle issues that cause major problems, and it also improves code readability for coders and architects who are familiar with the patterns.


	Multitasking is when multiple processes share common processing resources such as a CPU. 

	Multi-threading extends the idea of multitasking into applications where you can subdivide specific operations within a single application into individual threads. 

	Each of the threads can run in parallel. The OS divides processing time not only among different applications, but also among each thread within an application.

	Multi-threading enables you to write in a way where multiple activities can proceed concurrently in the same program.
